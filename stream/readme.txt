If you want to stream your tournament, remember these things:
- prepare a custom broadcast HUD. CS2's default spectator HUD is not built with tournament streaming in mind.
  use something like drweissbrot's cs-hud (https://github.com/drweissbrot/cs-hud)
- prepare multiple scenes (game, break, map veto (optional), and other) to hide your game while typing in the server IP to avoid unwanted players
- you need to have a stable internet connection and a quite good computer to handle the stream
- always stream in minimum 1080p (60 fps if possible)
- make sure your game is also set to the same resolution as your stream as anything else will look quite bad

this part of the repository will be expanded with OBS settings I used to stream with and other stuff like that
